Ghost Stories
------------

We write a lot of legal documents that contain Pivotal stories for scoping purposes. This makes generating those brain-dead simple.

## Setup
`git clone git@github.com:alexmcpherson/ghost-stories.git`

`cd ghost-stories`

`bundle`

You'll need to have [PhantomJS](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/downloads/list "PhantomJS") available in your path.

This is intended to be run locally for now, so

`shotgun`

and hit `lvh.me:9393`

Paste in your API key from Pivotal's Profile page, and drag the new link to your bookmark bar.

From any Pivotal project view, click the bookmarklet, and you'll get a download prompt for a nicely formatted, professional PDF file.

Awesome! (And spoooooooky)
